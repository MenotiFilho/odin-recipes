            <p>Just about as easy as opening one of those little boxes of shells and powdered 
                sauce—and a whooooole lot more delicious. Our super-quick stovetop mac and 
                cheese borrows from the method for a classic cacio e pepe pasta, but with a
                 bit of milk to make it extra creamy. No béchamel, no baking, just pure 
                 dairy-on-carbs joy.</p>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <div class="line"></div>
            
            <ol>
                <li><p>Add 3 big handfuls of kosher salt to a large pot of water and bring to a boil. 
                    (You're probably tired of us saying it all the time, but, yeah: Salting your pasta
                     water generously is the key to well-seasoned pasta, period.) Drop 1 lb. small shells 
                     into boiling water and give them a good stir to be sure nothing sticks. Set a timer 
                     according to package directions for al dente.</p></li>
                <li><p>Cut 1 stick chilled unsalted butter into 8 pieces.</p></li>
                <li><p>While pasta is cooking, heat 2 Tbsp. butter and 2 tsp. freshly ground pepper 
                    in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium, stirring occasionally, until butter
                     is melted and foaming, but not browned, and pepper is fragrant, about 1 minute.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add 1 cup whole milk to butter to stop it from browning and bring to a simmer. 
                    Whisk remaining 6 Tbsp. butter into milk mixture 1 Tbsp. at a time, allowing each to 
                    fully melt before adding the next. (Doing this gradually is important—it helps to emulsify your sauce.)
                     You may need to adjust your heat occasionally to maintain a simmer. If pasta still needs a few more minutes
                      to cook, turn off heat under your sauce, cover pot, and keep warm.</p></li>
                <li><p>Scoop up 2 cups pasta cooking liquid with a large glass measuring cup. You're probably not going to use
                     all of the pasta water in your sauce, but it's better to have more than you'll need.</p></li>
                <li><p>Drain pasta and add to pot with milk mixture. Return to medium heat and cook, tossing with a wooden
                     spoon to evenly coat all shells, about 30 seconds.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add about one-third of grated Parmesan, stirring pasta vigorously with wooden spoon to melt.
                     Add about ½ cup reserved pasta water and continue to stir until combined. Repeat this process
                      2 more times with remaining Parmesan. You may not need all of the pasta water, so add ½ cup
                       at a time until pasta is very creamy and well coated. It’s always good to err on the side
                        of looser (with a little extra pasta water) because the sauce will thicken as it cools.
                         Give it a taste and add more salt, if needed.</p></li>
                <li><p>Divide pasta between bowls—or just heap it into one big bowl for yourself,
                     no judgie—and serve right away.</p></li>
